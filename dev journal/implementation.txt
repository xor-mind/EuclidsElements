!! I'm learning as I go, I'm not an expert or have someone to guide me !!

So far within the first couple of definitions, postulates and propositions, I don't see where a coordinate system is discussed. 

We have data structure for points, but Euclid makes no mention of coordinates. Points don't possess inner coordinates. They are just there. 

But when you think about what the greeks were doing, using a compass and straightedge to position points and other geometries, there's an implied coordinate system. there's a space the greeks were working within, that that the points existed in. the points were the atoms of this space, but they indeed had relative position in the geometry. 

So with each point in my C++ model of EG, the point will represent a spatial point, and therefore have coords associated with it. I imaigne I could have a list of points, and a separate data structue


world = { at (3,5) let there be a point a, at (9, 22) let there be a point b. 
create a line
between a and b.

2Dpoint : point
{
  x, y
} a(3,5), b(9,2)...

So a point realy is nothing, but it can be placed in a 2d plane and represent the smallest bit possible. So a spatial point, is a point with additional information, i.e. the spatial information.
